We increasingly live in a world constructed by code and built by coders. That is why I’ve embarked on a career change as a software engineer having worked as a social media specialist for the past 10 years. My career has predominantly serviced the marketing and communications functions across a diverse range of organisations operating in the private, public and third sector. Most recently, I've spent 4 years working in the insurance industry as the UK's Social Media Manager for Hiscox, an FTSE100 company. Whilst at Hiscox I realised the importance of coding as a skill, and how it impacted most of the projects I was involved in which ultimately led me to change my career.

I find it very stimulating that coding allows you to find a creative solution towards solving a problem and it drives you to continuously learn so that you can be at the forefront of your trade.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

At Hiscox, I led a project that aimed to generate leads through social media advertising. The project involved coordinating and working with external tech and creative teams together with internal data controllers. In order to achieve success I had to work closely with these teams to overcome technical difficulties and reach compromises to ensure the project stayed on track. Part of the project involved managing stakeholder expectations and ensuring the project remained front of mind ampngst other priorities.

#### Adaptability

I'm a highly adaptable individual, which has been reflected in both my professional and personal life. My career has led me to successfully work in different sectors and environaments, be it government, agency or multinational corporations. Each of these brining their own challenges and rewards. I've also lived many years in Latin America adapting to new languages and societies.

#### Crisis management

Throughout my career I have been commended on my crisis management skills and calmly dealing with sensitive issues. Whether dealing with a disgruntled customer or managing online communications for high profile incidents like WannaCry. I am adapt at working effectively under pressure and communicating with senior stakeholders in order to reach a resolution.

#### Foreign Languages

- Spanish (fluent)
- Italian (fluent)
- Portuguese (basic)
