Currently embarking on an exciting career change towards software engineering having worked as a social media specialist for the past 10 years across the private, public and third sector. My career has predominantly serviced the marketing and communications functions across a diverse range of organisations. Most recently, I've spent 4 years working in the insurance industry as the UK's Social Media Manager for Hiscox, a FTSE100 company. Whilst at Hiscox I realised the importance of coding as a skill, and how it impacted most of the projects I was involved in which ultimately led me to change my career.

I find it very stimulating that coding allows you to find a creative solution towards solving a problem and drives you to continuously learn so that you can be at the forefront of your trade.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

At Hiscox, I led a project that aimed to generate leads through social media advertising. The project involved coordinating and working with external tech and creative teams together with internal data controllers. In order to achieve success I had to work closely with these teams in order to overcome technical difficulties and reach compromises to ensure the project stayed on track. Part of this was also managing stakeholder expectations and ensuring the project remained front of mind for those involed.

#### Adaptability

I'm a highly adaptable individual, which has been reflected in both my professional and personal life. My career has led me to successfully work in different sectors and environaments, be it government, agency or multinational corporations. Each of these brining their own challenges and rewards. I've also lived many years in Latin America adapting to new languages and societies.

#### Crisis management

Throughout my career I have been commended on my crisis management skills and calmly dealing with sensitive issues. Whether dealing with a disgruntled customer or managing online communications for high profile incidents like WannaCry. I am adapt at working effectively under pressure and communicating with senior stakeholders in order to reach a resolution.

#### Foreign Languages

- Spanish (fluent)
- Italian (fluent)
- Portuguese (basic)
